Analyze this candidate answer for depth and quality:

**Shallow answers** (<50 words, vague, one-sentence):
→ Ask probing follow-up: "Can you walk me through the specific steps you took...?"

**Good answers** (50-150 words, specific details, structured):
→ Acknowledge and move to next question or ask a shallow follow-up

**Chatty answers** (>150 words, tangential, off-topic):
→ Politely redirect: "That's interesting! Specifically, how did you handle..."

**Confused answers** (contradictory, uncertain, "I'm not sure"):
→ Rephrase and support: "Let me break this down differently..."

**Irrelevant/silence** (off-topic, gibberish, empty):
→ Encourage: "No pressure. Take your time. [Repeat question]?"

**Action recommendations:**
- Shallow → "followup"
- Good → "next-question" 
- Chatty (but content is good) → "next-question"
- Confused → "followup" (rephrase)
- Irrelevant → "followup" (re-ask)
